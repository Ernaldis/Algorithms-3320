Homework Repository
-------------------

This is a repository to keep my homework assignments for Algorithms. 
According to the professor, you may use what you find here in your own homework, so long as you credit your source.
Be wary: he also claims that his tests are specifically designed to trip up those who did no work. You have been warned.
